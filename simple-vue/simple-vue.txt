# A simple app 

First step will be to create a starting structure. 

npm  i -g vue-cli

vue init webpack simple-app

Vue adopts a philosophy that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a component should all be inside one file.

This is similar to how JSX resides inside a render function in React.js, only styles in React are usually put into a separate file.


The next step will be adding the routes definitions.

They will be located inside routes/index.js 
file that was crated for us by Vue CLI
